            <p>Happiness is a fuzzy concept. To be happy can mean something different from one person to another, or from one day to the next.</p>
            <p>JoyNet links expressions of happiness together to create a constellation of connected experiences.</p>
            <p>JoyNet builds on the work of <a href="https://megagon.ai/happydb-a-happiness-database-of-100000-happy-moments/">HappyDB</a>, a database of 100,000 happy moments crowdsourced from users who were asked to recall experiences of happiness from the past 24 hours.</p>
            <p>There were no modifications made to the original dataset beyond removing results greater than a certain character length. There may be the occasional NSFW result.</p>
            <p>This project owes much to the work of the researchers behind HappyDB:
                Akari Asai, Sara Evensen, Behzad Golshan, Alon Halevy, Vivian Li, Andrei Lopatenko, 
                Daniela Stepanov, Yoshihiko Suhara, Wang-Chiew Tan, Yinzhan Xu, 
                ``HappyDB: A Corpus of 100,000 Crowdsourced Happy Moments'', LREC '18, May 2018. (to appear)</p>
